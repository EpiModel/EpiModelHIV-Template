# Netsim Explore

## Goal

In this step we run the model locally to understand its outputs and develop the
new `EpiModel` modules.

## The scripts

- **1-explore_netsim.R**: Run the simulation with the installed `EpiModelHIV`
  package and explore the output.
- **2-module_dev.R**: Run the simulation with the local version of
  `EpiModelHIV`. This script is to test the modules during the development
  process.

## What to edit

This step is meant for exploration. It is suggested that you duplicate these
scripts and play with them. Keep the original ones as templates.
