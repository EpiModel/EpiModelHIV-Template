# Calibration

## Goal

Make the restart point required to run the final intervention. This step allows
you to run the final simulations before / while the model is being calibrated.

Run the script locally and the corresponding workflow on the HPC and move on to
the interventions.

## The scripts

- 0-restart_point_single.R: make a dummy restart point

## What to edit

Nothing.

## On the HPC

The workflow runs the same script on the HPC to prep it for the last steps.
