# Interventions Explore

## Goal

In this step we restart the model locally to understand its outputs and test the
new `EpiModel` modules.

## The scripts

- **1-explore_netsim.R**: Run the simulation with the installed `EpiModelHIV` package and explore the output.
- **2-module_dev.R**: Run the simulation with the local version of `EpiModelHIV`. This script is to test the modules during the development process.

## What to edit

This step is meant for exploration. It is suggested that you duplicate these scripts and play with them. Keep the original ones as templates.

- local Interventions -> test the restart system + scenarios api (2 files)
- analysis file
- scenarios workflow
  -> run scenarios
  -> perform analysis (empty analysis files at first?) (or commented?)
